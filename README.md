<h1>Pytest Gui</h1>

A simple gui created with CustomTkinter allowing users to execute pytests and create HTML or JSON test reports. Intended for users that need to run integration tests without any Python programming knowledge.

The gui has been implemented in a simple MVC architecture and the tests run in a seperate thread to avoid freezing the gui during test execution.
